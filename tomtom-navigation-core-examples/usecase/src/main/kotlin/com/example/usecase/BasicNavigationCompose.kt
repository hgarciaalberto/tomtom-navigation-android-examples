/**
 * This example shows how to build a simple navigation application using the TomTom Navigation SDK for Android.
 * The application displays a map and shows the user’s location. After the user selects a destination with a long click, the app plans a route and draws it on the map.
 * Navigation is started in a simulation mode, once the user taps on the route.
 * The application will display upcoming manoeuvres, remaining distance, estimated time of arrival (ETA), current speed, and speed limit information.
 *
 * For more details on this example, check out the tutorial: https://developer.tomtom.com/android/navigation/documentation/use-cases/build-a-navigation-app
